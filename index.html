        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p><i>Written by Aadarsh Sasi Kumar</i></p>
        <p>
            As a student of masters it's important to understand how to structure a
            master thesis. Because findings done after the research should be
            written in a way that readers can understand easily without misleading
            or missing any important part of the paper. So to write a good
            scientific paper we have taken 2 models primarily , such as CARS model
            and IMRAD model.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Basically the CaRS Model can help you build an introduction. The model
            consists of three rhetorical moves that help identify the background,
            motivation, and focus of the research as presented in
            <a href="#r13">[1]</a> ". "Similarly “IMRaD” format refers to a paper
            that is structured by four main sections: Introduction, Methods,
            Results, and Discussion.
        </p>
        <p><i>Written by Sanika Humbe</i></p>
        <p>This format resembles an hourglass shape structure. In other words, it begins broadly, then focuses narrowly,
            and then broadens again. The introduction starts wide and then narrows down. For instance, it may first note
            the general importance of the subject, then summarise previous research on it, and then identify the
            specific question that the current research addressed. The methods section and results section focus
            narrowly on the research being reported. The discussion broadens out again. For instance, it may interpret
            the current findings, then relate them to other research, and then discuss their wider relevance.

        <p>
            In this report we have proposed a variation of the IMRAD format and CARS model to structure the thesis. As
            it's very difficult to find a scientific thesis report which can demonstrate structure which uses both
            models, we have taken two separate scientific papers to demonstrate the CARS model with examples. Also
            provided a checklist for thesis writing.

        <h2>2. Method</h2>
        <p><i>Written by Sanika Humbe</i></p>
        <p>
            The format of scientiﬁc papers has evolved during the past several
            years, and will continue to evolve. We are inclined to IMRAD format and
            CARS model for thesis report structuring. “The modular structure of
            IMRAD helps the author to organise ideas and remember critical elements;
            it makes easier for the editor and the reviewer to evaluate manuscripts;
            and it improves the efﬁciencyof the scientist to locate speciﬁc
            information without going through the entire paper.

        <h2>2.1 Abstract</h2>
        <p><i>Written by Sanika Humbe</i></p>
        <p>
            The abstract of the report aims to provide a summary of the purpose,
            main findings, and implications of the study. It gives a brief overview
            of the entire report, giving readers an idea of what to expect. It
            provides a statement of what the thesis will ask or explore rather than
            what it found. And it provides general categories rather than specific
            details in the findings In constructing the abstract, it is important to
            also include a synopsis of the thesis report, highlighting the
            background information related to the topic and emphasising the
            importance of the current study. Additionally, identifying gaps in
            previous research helps to establish the context for the study.

        <h2>2.2 Introduction using CARS Model (Create a Research Space)</h2>
        <p><i>Written by Aadarsh Sasi Kumar</i></p>
        <p>
            The introduction is the most important part of any scientific topic or
            paper because it helps the readers to understand the particular paper
            without reading the whole context. So basically by following the CARS
            model we can write a good introduction that describes the papers well.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="Image1.png" alt="Overview of CARS Model" height="500" />
            <figcaption>
                <strong>Figure 1</strong>: Overview of CARS Model

        </figure>
        <p>
            As shown in Figure 1, The model follows like " “Establishing the
            territory” the author tries to give a basic introduction about the
            topic. In the second one, “Establishing the niche” the author finds a
            gap in a certain topic which he or she takes as an initial motivation
            and tries to resolve through the research. The last one, “Occupying the
            niche”, is an important part of the CARS model, where the author tries
            to submit all the findings that he or she has done
            <a href="#r13">[3]</a>."
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Move 1 : Establishing the territory</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="Image2.png" alt="Establishing the territory" />
            <figcaption>
                <strong>Figure 2</strong>: Establishing the territory
                <a href="#r13">[3]</a>.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            "In this move, the author sets the context for his or her research,
            providing the necessary background on the topic <a href="#r13">[3]</a>."
            There are three steps to satisfy the move.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 1 : Claiming centrality</h4>
        <p>
            As readers are also the writers they will be able to understand the
            domain which they are looking for by mentioni ng the centrality of the
            niche, so it's easy for them to categorise their research in a certain
            way. So as a writer it's important to mention under what domain the
            paper will fit in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <br />
            <br />

            " Recently there has been a spate of interest in ...
            <a href="#r13">[3]</a> ".
        </p>
        <h4>Step 2 : Making topic generalisation</h4>
        <p>
            During the research process or in some time due to the problems they
            found in certain areas, writers write papers by highlighting that
            particular problem which will normally convert into the topic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <br />
            <br />

            " Properties of X are still not completely understood
            <a href="#r13">[3]</a> " .
        </p>
        <h4>Step 3 : Reviewing Previous Items of Research</h4>
        <p>
            As this is a common step in almost every scientific paper, to find out
            to what extent that domain has been explored, we need previous research
            papers. By mentioning them the readers can widen their knowledge on the
            particular problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <br />
            <br />

            " Both Johnson and Morgan claim that the biographical facts have been
            misrepresented <a href="#r13">[3]</a>
            " .
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Move 2 : Establishing the Niche</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="Image3.png" alt="Establishing the Niche" />
            <figcaption>
                <strong>Figure 3</strong>: Establishing the Niche
                <a href="#r13">[3]</a>.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            "In this move, the author argues that there is an open "niche" in the
            existing research, a space that needs to be filled through additional
            research. The author can establish a niche in one of the four ways
            <a href="#r13">[3]</a> ".
        </p>
        <p>
            So a beginner who is writing scientific papers, it's important to
            clearly describe our target audience and how we proceed with our
            findings. In a writer's point of view, giving a strong opinion on a
            topic is important, which adds value to the paper during the publishing.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 1A : Counter-claiming</h4>
        <p>
            As a writer as well as reader it will be helpful for them to make clear
            understanding of a particular topic which they are looking for , so by
            doing that they can clearly point out the previous research or an
            followed method is indicating something wrong about a certain topic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <br />
            <br />

            " While Jones and Riley believe X method to be accurate, a close
            examination demonstrates their method to be flawed
            <a href="#r13">[3]</a> ".
        </p>
        <h4>Step 1B : Indicating a Gap</h4>
        <p>
            So in this particular move, we came to understand that the writer
            describes the gap he or she found during the research, but not
            mentioning how to tackle the problem, which will be followed in the
            later section.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <br />
            <br />

            " While existing studies have clearly established X, they have not
            addressed Y <a href="#r13">[3]</a> ".
        </p>
        <h4>Step 1C : Question-raising</h4>
        <p>
            The main difference between Step 1 and Step 3 is that Step 1 describes
            the problem which should be rectified, but Step 3 explains the unclear
            situation about a certain niche.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <br />
            <br />

            " While Jones and Morgan have established X, these findings raise a
            number of questions, including ... <a href="#r13">[3]</a> ".
        </p>
        <h4>Step 1D : Continuing a tradition</h4>
        <p>
            "The paper tries to follow the same pattern as the rest of the paper
            with an improved result at the end. <a href="#r13">[3]</a>". So most of
            the papers in a scientific section we are able to see following this
            tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <br />
            <br />

            " Earlier studies seemed to suggest X. To verify this finding, more work
            is urgently needed <a href="#r13">[3]</a> ".
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Move 3 : Occupying the niche</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="Image4.png" alt="Occupying the niche" />
            <figcaption>
                <strong>Figure 4</strong>: Occupying the niche <a href="#r13">[3]</a>.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            The main difference between move 2 and move 3 is that the author shows
            some proof which he or she found after the research as an end result.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a crucial part of structuring a paper's introduction, because in
            move 2, we are providing our concrete view to write a paper. But through
            move 3 we confirm the readers that our claims are true, by giving the
            proof through our research.
        </p>
        <p>There are four ways to Occupy a niche according to CARS model,</p>
        <h4>Step lA : Outlining Purposes</h4>
        <p>
            " In this section the author provides the theme of the paper which he or
            she found, but not exactly the result of the paper
            <a href="#r13">[3]</a>".
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <br />
            <br />

            " In this article I argue ... <a href="#r13">[3]</a> ".
        </p>
        <h4>Step lB : Announcing present research</h4>
        <p>
            "The author describes the research in the current article
            <a href="#r13">[3]</a>"
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <br />
            <br />

            " This paper describes three separate studies conducted between March
            2008 and January 2009. <a href="#r13">[3]</a> ".
        </p>
        <h4>Step 2 : Announcing principle findings</h4>
        <p>
            This section will come under the scope in some papers as in this section
            the author will mention to what extent the paper will cover, so the
            readers will get an early preview of the paper.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <br />
            <br />

            " The results of the study suggest ... <a href="#r13">[3]</a> ".
        </p>

        <p><i>Written by Aadarsh Sasi Kumar</i></p>
        <p>
            Motivation is a crucial part of writing any paper because most of the
            motivation comes from problems faced by the individual previously in a
            certain area in which the person is trained. So we have taken an example
            to point out how to create motivation.

        <p>
            The literature review section serves to provide background information
            on the thesis topic. Reading papers related to background information,
            listing down some related sources, trying to understand what is missing
            from their research, all this critical discussion can be put in
            literature review. It answers the state of the field and aims to define
            the current understanding of the topic. To construct the literature
            review, it is necessary to conduct background research on the research
            question, evaluate and annotate sources, and look for patterns and gaps
            in the existing literature. By analysing where researchers agree and
            disagree in the field, a thesis literature review can be developed.

            Result is the most important section of a thesis, which helps to show
            what it is that you've actually found. This is your contribution to the
            field. You can decide the results you want to present and the order in
            which you want to present them. So that some of the results get
            foregrounded while others get backgrounded. Make use of visuals, such as
            tables, figures, diagrams, charts to tell the particular story that you
            want to tell. The results section answers the question of what was found
            in the study. It describes the outcomes of the research and presents the
            data and facts discovered during the study. Key findings are outlined,
            providing a comprehensive overview of the study's results.

        <h2>2.6 Discussion</h2>
        <p><i>Written by Sanika Humbe</i></p>
        <p>
            Main body of the thesis includes the Method and Result section which are
            mostly descriptive but the discussion section will be more analytical
            and critical. Discuss and interpret your findings and connect them to
            previous research on the topic that is of relevance. And then broadens
            out to discuss the significance of these results to the field. It
            outlines the strengths and limitations of the study and highlights its
            relevance to current literature. The implications of the study are
            discussed. It also suggests future research.
        </p>

            Just like there are some moves in the introduction, a pattern of moves
            can also be determined in the case of the discussion. John Swales and
            Christine Feak have mapped these into the following five stages.
        </p>
        <div>
            <b>Move 1: </b>Presentation of background information, it appears in some, but
            not all reports
        </div>
        <div><b>Move 2 :</b> Is the obligatory, which is summarising key results</div>
        <div><b>Move 3 : </b>Actual discussion of results takes place</div>
        <div>
            <b>Move 4 :</b> Sometimes it might be necessary to mention the limitations of
            your study,And finally
        </div>
        <div><b>Move 5 :</b> Suggests further research or broader implications</div>

        <h2>2.7 Conclusion</h2>
        <p><i>Written by Sanika Humbe</i></p>
        <p>
            The Conclusion is about how you want to conclude the thesis. It includes
            takeaway messages and what are the limitations along with what you've
            found. It summarises the overall findings of the study and their
            implications. It states the importance of the thesis statement and gives
            the thesis a sense of completeness. The conclusion leaves a final
            impression on the reader, highlighting the impact of the study.

            The references section lists the literature that has made significant
            contributions to the field. It includes accurate citations, focusing on
            the most relevant, rigorous, and recent literature. Only published
            journal articles or books should be quoted in the references section.

            We have come up with the modified IMRaD and C.A.R.S. style checklist for
            thesis writing. This style can be used for thesis structuring but also
            any scientific reports in the sciences, engineering, and the computer
            sciences field. To construct this checklist table we took help of
            reference “Lab Report – IMRaD Style ‐ Quick Guide” [num] significantly.

            We have also created a flowchart to represent all the blocks and its
            flow in visual format.

        <h2>4. Limitations and Discussion</h2>
        <p><i>Written by Sanika Humbe</i></p>
        <p>
            We were not able to find a specific thesis which follows the same
            structure as mentioned in the report but most of the scientific
            writings, research papers follow a similar structure so we have sampled
            some examples from a couple of research papers. It's important to also
            note that this provided flowchart and checklist is a general structure
            for the thesis. The actual flow and content may slightly vary depending
            on the specific requirements and nature of your research project.
